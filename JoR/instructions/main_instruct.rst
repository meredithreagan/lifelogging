Welcome to the Experiment!
==========================

In this task you will be shown pairs of images from your own life.

After each pair is shown, you will be asked which of the two images actually
happened more recently in real life.

Press F if the first image actually happened more recently.

Press J if the second image actually happened more recently.


There will be 24 pairs in each block and 4 blocks total. At the end of each
block you will have the opportunity to rest if you like.


When you are ready to proceed, press Enter.
