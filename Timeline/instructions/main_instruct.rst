Welcome to the Experiment!
==========================

In this task you will be shown images from your own life.

As each image is shown, you will see a timeline marked off with the 3 weeks you
spent collecting lifelogging data. Click on the timeline to indicate in which
week you believe event in the picture actually happened.

Next you will see a timeline representing the days of the week. Click to
indicate which day you believe the event happened.

Next you will see a timeline representing the hours of the day. Click to
indicate which hour you believe the event happened.

Finally, you will see a slider representing your confidence in how accurately
you remembered the time of the event. Click the point along the line that
corresponds to however confident you feel, from very low confidence to very high
confidence.

You will only be able to click each line once, after which the next will
appear. Please try to answer as quickly as possible.


There will be 24 pairs in each block and 8 blocks total. At the end of each
block you will have the opportunity to rest if you like.


When you are ready to proceed, press Enter.
