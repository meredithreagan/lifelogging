In the following task, you will be shown photos that were taken during the course
of the three weeks that you wore the lifelogging device. As the picture first appears, a timeline will appear with it.
There are three timelines, one with WEEKS, one with DAYS, and one with HOURS.
You will first estimate the WEEK the photo was taken (Week 1, Week 2, or Week 3),
by clicking on the timeline.
After you choose the WEEK you believe the photo was taken, the timeline for DAYS will appear.
You will then choose the DAY of the week you believe the photo was taken.
A third timeline will then appear, and you will estimate the HOUR of the day that
the photo was taken.
Lastly, a CONFIDENCE RATING line will appear. Please rate how confident you were (from NOT AT ALL CONFIDENT to VERY CONFIDENT)
for your time estimates. After your confidence rating, the next picture will appear.
You will only be able to click each timeline once, after which it will be disabled.
You will then be forced to move to the next timeline.  You will NOT be able to go back and change
your answers once you've clicked on each timeline.

Please answer as quickly and as accurately as possible.
