Welcome to the Experiment!
==========================

In this task you will be shown a series of images from your own life. When each
image comes on the screen, focus on the image and try to mentally relive it in
vivid detail.

Between images, a fixation cross (+) will be shown. Please keep your eyes on the
cross until the next image appears.

After each image you will be asked some questions:

    1. Did you remember the event?

    2. Were you able to remember it vividly?

For each question, press Button 1 for YES or Button 2 for NO. (If you answer the
first question NO, the second question will be skipped.) After a couple seconds
the questions will disappear, so try and answer quickly!

There will be 32 images in each block and 6 blocks total. At the end of each
block you will see a long fixation cross, after which you will have the
opportunity to rest if you like.


When you are ready to proceed, press any key on the Button Box.
